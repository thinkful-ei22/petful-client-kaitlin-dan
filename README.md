## Save a Life. Adopt a Pet

### Brief Description
A single-page web app for an animal shelter to facilitate adoption of cats and dogs. The adoption process works strictly on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. You can adopt a cat or a dog, or both, but you may only adopt the animals that have been in the shelter the longest.

### Tech Stack
The app uses React for the frontend and Redux for state management.

### Deployed version
